#### General rules for posting

- üèõ We host here open **discussions to support our community**.
- #Ô∏è‚É£ Discussions are grouped up in different **categories**. Thus, choose the category that best represents your post.
- ‚ùî Post here **general questions**. Try to avoid reporting bugs and/or requests that are repo-specific;
  for this purpose, instead, rely on the issue tracking system of the relative repository (e.g. [**`yarp`**](https://github.com/robotology/yarp),
  [**`icub-main`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main) ...).
- üëÄ Before raising a new question, please check whether your problem has already found a possible solution by
  [**searching among existing discussions**](../../../discussions).
- üîç [**Advanced search syntax**][1] is also available for discussions.
- ‚öô Post on [**`icub-tech-support`**](https://github.com/robotology/icub-tech-support) any request for robot maintenance
  (e.g. issues related to hardware, generic devices, robot configuration files, updates of the robot operating system).

If you would like us to review your code, please post your snippets to [**`Gist`**](https://gist.github.com),
including instructions to run them.
